## 1. Land Surface Temperature in Munich (Landsat Imagery)

- Google Earth Engine (GEE) code for calculating Land Surface Temperature (LST) in Munich.
- Uses Landsat imagery.
- No download required; visualization is done directly in GEE.

## 2. Sentinel-2 Multi-Band Image Collection for German Tree Species

- Sentinel-2 image collections for 12 German tree species.
- Extracted based on geographic occurrence data of different tree species in GEE.
